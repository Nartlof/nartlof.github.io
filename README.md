After many years relying on my memory to retain information, I realized it is no longer as it used to be. I graduated in civil engineering without filling one single notebook. Many of my teachers and tutors commented on how I would fail on their courses without taking notes, but I did not. I was able to recall from memory every lesson and tell which pages of the textbooks something was discussed.

Years passed and I got old. That is a good thing because all the people I knew who have not gotten old have died young. I would definitely hate to have died young, however I can not say I love being older. My memory, among other things, does not work as before. It became harder to put new things in and difficult to take things out. The whole process is now too unreliable for my taste.

I convinced myself I have no other option than start taking notes, but I do recognise the inconvenience and lack of practicality a bunch of notebooks have. I am from the word processing age, when typewriters gave place to software. Now that is already history. If I started to take notes in a notebook, with paper and pencil, what would come next? Should I hunt mastodons for dinner as well? Notebooks are out of question.

This assemblage of webpages is my answer to that problem. I am writing this mainly to myself. It is my way to keep notes on the stuff I do, in the case I have to do that again, and also help someone else who is stuck in a problem I have already solved.

## Me

I am a civil engineer by training and software developer by trade. I graduated from the State University at Campinas, where I also got my masters degree in structures and PhD on computational mechanics. For a time I dreamed of following an academic career, but life chose otherwise. Since 2004 I have dedicated myself to the development of webcommerce, database management and programming of microcontrollers. I studied Computer Engineering for two years, between 2018 and 2020, and had to stop when my class was dismissed because of the Covid19 pandemic.

I also maintain the Brazilian mirror for the [Frank Philipseâ€™s Vacuum Tube Data Sheets](https://tubedata.altanatubes.com.br/) database and the [Brazilian search engine](https://tubedata.altanatubes.com.br/search/) for the site.
